For CodeGen:
------------
My static link is always at PBO.
My local variables are at offsets LBO, LBO - 4, LBO - 8, ..., LBO - 4 * (n - 1),
  where n is the number of local variables and LBO is the locals base offset.
My formals are at offsets PBO + 4, ..., PBO + 4 * n, where n is the
  number of formal parameters and PBO is the params base offset.



Why you should use my module:
-----------------------------
I currently have queens.tig and merge.tig working when combined with modules
CGY and RAY.
